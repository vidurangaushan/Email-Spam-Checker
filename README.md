# Email-Spam-Checker

Spam email is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes. It can be sent in massive volume by botnets, networks of infected computers. While some people view it as unethical, many businesses still use spam. The cost per email is incredibly low, and businesses can send out mass quantities consistently. Spam email can also be a malicious attempt to gain access to your computer. "Ham" is e-mail that is not Spam. In other words, "non-spam", or "good mail". It should be considered a shorter, snappier synonym for "non-spam".
